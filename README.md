# Videogame tracker

## Overview
This application allows users to create a list of games which they enjoy. They can create and login to an account, and they can remove/add games from their list.

## installation 
This program  uses php and mysql so you will need to install those on your machine if you haven't done so already.
It has been tested with a xampp control panel, so in order to run it you will need an apache web server and a mysql database.
